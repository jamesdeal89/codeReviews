"""
This coding challenge was later revealed to be an implementation of 'cellular automaton'. https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Cellular_automaton
Given a set of rules, return a boolean value based on three inputs.
For example:
if a rule 100|1 is set, return 1 if 1,0,0 is input. 
This should be implemented in a class with rules as an attribute.

"""
- Using a 2D list
- create a representation of a checkers board's starting state (just the player positions)
- N.B. You do not have to make any game functionality
- Just a 2D list containing the starting state.
- pass in the square board's size as a parameter
- the minimum board size is 8, each player should have three rows of checkers
- checkers should alternate
- one player has red checkers (R)
- one player has white checkers (W)

Additionally please make a function to print out the checkerboard neatly (you may use whatever suitable symbols you like)

The board of size 8 should look like this (just a representation) (_ represents an empty space, R represents a red checker, W represents a white Checker, spaces are not required)

_ R _ R _ R _ R
R _ R _ R _ R _
_ R _ R _ R _ R
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
_ W _ W _ W _ W
W _ W _ W _ W _
_ W _ W _ W _ W
